# Puzzle-Question
Problem: You have 12 balls identical in size and appearance but 1 is an odd weight (could be either light or heavy). You have a classic balance to measure them against each other. In just 3 weightings, how can you determine which ball is the odd one and whether it's lighter or heavier?
Solution:
First, weigh 4 balls against 4 other balls.
If they balance, then the odd ball is in the remaining 4. Weigh 2 of these against each other. If they balance, weigh the remaining 2 to find the odd one. If they don't balance, you know which is the odd one and whether it's lighter or heavier.
If the first weighing doesn't balance, take the 4 balls that were lighter. Weigh 2 against each other. If they balance, weigh the remaining 2 to find the odd one. If they don't balance, you know which is the odd one and it's lighter.
